- Comment box for recipes. Perhaps use it via a socket.io method?
- Create a ratings system for recipes.
- Create a wishlist or "my favorites" for recipes.
- Convert project to NextJS.
- Add min/max lengths for passwords, usernames, names, emails, recipes, recipe info, etc
- Make a username clickable to view a user's profile and the rest of their recipes.
- On MyRecipes, make it display more information to the user. Description and pictures to make it more recognizable at a glance.
- Have selectors for recipes to indicate if it's vegan or vegetarian or something similar.
- Add a description to each recipe? Maybe just the ingredients, time, and pictures will do.
- Add pagination to all recipes, my recipes, searching recipes.
- Add accessibility with <label> on inputs.
- Rework ViewRecipePage to use CSS Grid so sizing on resolutions will change the layout. Style ViewRecipePage.
- When a user logs out, clear redux.
- Make the account page sides, left and right, into separate components to load onto multiple pages such as my account, my recipes, edit recipe. Potential to use for viewing other person's profile. Might look bad on all recipes or search. Can use for user specific stuff.

Efficiency improvements:
- See if we can clean up processData function in userRecipes.js action.
- Package moment is rather bulky when compiled. See if we can just do dates ourselves with a function.

+/ Rework the ServerAPI call and make it useful for all API calls. //Sort of already did, sort of.
