    var:
    - With var variables, we can reassign it AND redefine it.
    -- reassigning: var nameVar = 'Evan' ... nameVar = 'Mike'
    -- redefining: var nameVar = 'Evan' ... var nameVar = 'Mike'
    - Var variables are function-scoped. Each variable is specific to the function it was created in.
    - It is not block-scoped, meaning it can work outside of if, for, or other conditional statements. If var is defined inside, it can be used outside of it.

    let:
    - With let variables, we can reassign it but cannot redefine it.
    - let variables are function-scoped. Cannot use outside of function.
    - It is block-scoped. Cannot use let variable outside of conditional or loops.

    const:
    - With const variables, we cannot reassign nor redefine it.
    - const variables are function-scoped. Cannot use outside of function.
    - It is block-scoped. Cannot use let variable outside of conditional or loops.
